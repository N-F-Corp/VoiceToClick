## Status
We are at the start of this project. There isn't anything to show. 
For now it is only for them, who want to contribute to this project, but as soon as the project gets in a production state we should be able to uploade it in the chrome webstore.
Please wait until we are able to release or help by contributing, and if you realy like the idea please star or watch this repository.
